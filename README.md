**How to use Github and GIT**
  _Github and GIT_
  
      Github is a company that provides hosting for software development version control using GIT.
    GIT itself is actually a protocol used as a version control system that lets you manage and keep 
    track of your source code history. We will be using GIT _by_ using Github, meaning that GIT is 
    never directly used. It's all done through Github.
    
      Firstly, you'll want to make a Github account. This will allow to view an unlimited amount of   
    public and private repositories on GitHubs website. Making an account is free, it you only need  
    to upgrade if you plan on working on a private project that includes more than 3 collaborators.
    
      For this tutorial, I will not be installing **GIT** on the system localy, but I will go in detail if you wished to do so. Git was originally created by OS founding father Linus Torvald, the creator of Linux
